# Expression-Based-MusicRecommendation System


Introduction:

The project ‘Expression Based Music Recomendation System ’  deals with detecting emotion of an individual through facial expression and playing music according to the mood detected that will alleviate the mood or simply calm the individual and can also get quicker song according to the mood. 
The webcam captures the image of the user. It then extracts the facial features of the user from the captured image. Facial expression categorized into 2, smiling and not smiling.  
The foremost concept of this project is to automatically play songs based on the emotions of the user.  
It aims to provide user-preferred music with respect to the emotions detected.. 


HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS: 
The project can be run on any hardware specifications given a good and stable internet connection. 
The hardware specifications of the machine the website was designed: 
RAM : 12.0 GB (11.9 GB usable) 
ROM : 1TB 
OS: Windows 10, 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor 
Touch Support with 10 Touch Points 
CPU : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz 1.80 GHz 


SOFTWARE SPECIFICATIONS: 
For execution, python must be installed in the user’s system along with any software like Pycharm or Anaconda. 
Technologies Used:- 
1.	API : An application programming interface is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification 
 
 
2.	NoSQL: A NoSQL originally referring to non SQL or non relational is a database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. This data is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases came into existence in the late 1960s, but did not obtain the NoSQL moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first century. NoSQL databases are used in real-time web applications and big data and their use are increasing over time. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called Not only SQL to emphasize the fact that they may support SQL-like query languages. 
 
A NoSQL database includes simplicity of design, simpler horizontal scaling to clusters of machines and finer control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL databases are different from those used by default in relational databases which makes some operations faster in NoSQL. The suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it should solve. Data structures used by NoSQL databases are sometimes also viewed as more flexible than relational database tables. 
 
 
3.	ML Model : A machine learning model is an expression of an algorithm that combs through mountains of data to find patterns or make predictions. Fueled by data, machine learning (ML) models are the mathematical engines of artificial intelligence. 
For example, an ML model for computer vision might be able to identify cars and pedestrians in a real-time video. One for natural language processing might translate words and sentences. 
 
Under the hood, a machine learning model is a mathematical representation of objects and their relationships to each other. The objects can be anything from “likes” on a social networking post to molecules in a lab experiment. 
 
 
4.	Pycharm: PyCharm is an integrated development environment used in computer programming, specifically for the Python programming language. It is developed by the Czech company JetBrains.

Play the songs according to the user’s mood. A random generator is put to generate songs randomly for a specific mood.
